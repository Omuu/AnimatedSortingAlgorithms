# AnimatedSortingAlgorithms

I saw this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) video, "15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes", and I thought to myself, 

I should make my own - worse - version.

Requires SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php), C++11, CMake (http://www.cmake.org), and a prayer, to make it work. When built, place the .dll files from SFML/bin in the same directory as the executable, as well as the font file arial.ttf.
